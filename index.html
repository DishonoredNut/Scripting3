    <img

    <p>  So this is one of the images that I will majorly take inspiration from,</p> 
    <p> I will be trying to create a landscape view using HTML and CSS. </p>
    <p> It's also good to note that I created the above image as well, in photoshop of course. </p>
    <p>  of course that's subject to change as well. </p>
