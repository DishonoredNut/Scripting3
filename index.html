        Inspiration image: 
    </h1>
    <img
        src="CPA1/Images/maxresdefault (1).jpg" width = 720  , height = 480 
        class="img-fluid rounded-top"

    <p>  So this is the image that I will majorly take inspiration from,</p> 
    <p> I will be trying to create a simple CAT HTML and CSS. </p>
    <p> I will be using my own, REAL cat as reference for my own HTML Cat however: . </p>

    <img
        src="CPA1/Images/Holly.jpg" width = 720  , height = 480
        class="img-fluid rounded-top"
        alt=""
    /> <!-- 16/03/2024, Image Of the cat. -->
    <p>  of course these things are subject to change considering my original intention which was:  </p>
    <img
        src="CPA1/Images/Weapon Grab.png " width = 720  , height = 480
        class="img-fluid rounded-top"
        alt=""
    /> <!--16/02/2024, Weapon Grab landscape-->
    <p> A Landscape of my own creation from photoshop, but it's way too complex so CAT it is! </p>


<h2> 
    Color pallette for the image: 
</h2>

    <p> 
        Since my cat is herself black, white ann brown, that will be the color palatte of the image once it is created. 
    </p>

    <h2> 
        Design Structure: 
    </h2>
    <p> 
        Considering the fact that the creation of the image will be done on this created website, 
        <p> I'd like to create a better structure for this very site to be more "Sophisticated" in design.</p>
